# User Research

I did a lot of user testing with people who had experiences on design and people who didn't, the first design is what i went with but after complaints of not knowing it was a clickable button I decided to increase the font weight as well as add a pulsing dot beside it to draw the users attention towards the button.

The next issue I faced was with people not knowing where to click to open the projects.

import UserResearch from "../../components/my-website/UserResearch.astro";
